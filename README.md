# sandpack-bundler
Sandpack bundler hosted on Github Pages

## Usage
Refer to the docs [here](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs/guides/hosting-the-bundler) for usage information. The URL is `https://sandpack-bundler.coder0107git.v6.rocks/`.

## Pinning
Currently there isn't any way to pin the build. It's (re)built automatically 11:30 AM every Wednesday (UTC). If you need a static version, then use `{major}-{minor}-{bugfix}-sandpack.codesandbox.io` or fork this repo.

## Why?
Because my school blocks `*.codesandbox.com` and I want to be able to use Sandpack at school.
